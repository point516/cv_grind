# Diving into Computer Vision tasks
### 1) Image Captioning   
- BLIP_finetune - Finetuning BLIP architecture on detailed captioning for clothes.  
- BLIP_inference - Running pre-trained BLIP architecture without finetuning on the clothes dataset  
- ViT+decoder - implementing custom less heavy image captioning model with ViT as encoder and traditional decoder with BERT tokenizer for image captioning
